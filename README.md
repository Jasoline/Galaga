# Galaga
This is a remake of the popular game Galaga using the coding language Python and using the built in Pygame

What the project does:
This project is recreating the video game Galaga. Wikipedia sources Galaga back to 1981 where it is a fixed shooter arcade video game that was developed and published by Namco. Where players are controlling a starship, the player is tasked with destroying the Galaga forces in each stage while avoiding enemies and projectiles.

Why the project is useful:
Recreating older video games is a good way to practice new applied programming skills, as you have a model to look towards when the product is finished.

Getting started:
First, you can start the project with running the main.py file and then playing the game how you would with the original Galaga game. To play the game, the goal is for the player, on the left side of the screen, to defeat the enemy ships, on the right side of the screen. You use the W and S keys to move your ship up (W) and down (S) and use the spacebar to fire a projectile. When you successfully land a hit on an enemy ship, it will die and by doing this to all of the enemy ships, you are able to win the game.

Helpful information:
If you struggle with this game, simply refer back to this file to reread instructions. If there are any other problems that are not related to the game itself, please contact the creators.

Contributors:
Credit to the creators Halie Numinen and Lilly Jackson. They split the work pretty evenly and were able to work on it together seamlessly. They used techniques from previous projects such as software engineering classes and past python classes. Techniques such as music and image implementation was Lilly, while creating instances and importing files was due to Halieâ€™s intellect.
